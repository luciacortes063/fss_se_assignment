    "* As your submission, upload the filled Jupyter Notebook (including outputs) together with the d3 visualization web pages (i.e. upload everything you downloaded including the filled Jupyter Notebook plus your `output.json`)\n",
    "* The files must be uploaded to OLAT as a single ZIP (`.zip`) file by Dec 15, 2025 @ 23:55.\n"

    "The first task is to get an overview of the author ownership of the _elasticsearch_ project. In particular, we want to understand who are the main authors in the system between the two considered tags, the authors distribution among files and the files distribution among authors. To this aim, perform the following:\n",
    "- create a dictionary (or a list of tuples) with the pairs author => number of modified files\n",
    "- create a dictionary (or a list of tuples) with the pairs file => number of authors who modified the file\n",
    "- visualize the distribution of authors among files: the visualization should have on the x axis the number of authors per file (from 1 to max), and on the y axis the number of files with the given number of authors (so for example the first bar represent the number of files with single author)\n",
    "- visualize the distribution of files among authors: the visualization should have on the x axis the number of files per author (from 1 to max), and on the y axis the number of authors that own the given number of files (so for example the first bar represent the minor contributors, i.e., the number of authors who own 1 file)\n",
    "\n",

    "2. `src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index`\n",
    "3. `src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/action`\n",

To compute the value at the package level, you should aggregate the data per file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the function defined above, visualize the author contributions (lines added + lines removed). The visualization should have the author on the x axis, and the total lines on the y axis. Sort the visualization in decreasing amount of contributions, i.e., the main author should be the first.\n",
